# Rainbow Attack

This project is the second homework that is made for the course of SECG4. The objective is to attack a password table with a rainbow attack.

## Introduction

A rainbow attack is an hacking method to find password from hashes. To do so, we use a rainbow table or also called, rainbow hash table.

This method allows us to crack password more quickly than the bruteforce way.

In this exercice:
- the hash function is SHA-256.
- passwords are not salted
- passwords are alphanumeric of length 6 to 8 included.
- passwords are stored after a simple pass through the hash function

## Installation

For this exercice, we used C++17 to code on Linux.
